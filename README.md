# Scroller
Atari 8bit Scroller game

The code used in the 'Programming a Retro Game on the Atari 8bit' series.

Additional Information:

	Created a look alike Bounty Bob as the player. Only stand, walk, and jump animations are done.
	Created a level loader to accept a dataset of values to render the level.
	Added sound using RMT modules and RMT's SFX.RMT file. Need to figure out how to convert SAP or WAV to use in RMT.
