# Scroller
Atari 8bit Scroller game

The code that will be used in the upcomming series 'Programming a Retro Game on the Atari 8bit'.

Additional Information:

	Created a look alike Bounty Bob as the player. Only stand, walk, and jump animations are done.
	Created a level loader to accept a dataset of values to render the level.
	
	Added sound using RMT modules and RMT's SFX.RMT file. Need to figure out how to convert SAP to use in RMT.
	
	Include compiled AtariMapMaker so people can view and edit the map being used.
